Leaflet.Routing is a routing controller for the popular Leaflet mapping
framework. The module provides an intuitive interface for routing paths between
waypoints using any user specified routing service. A demo using the OSM data
can be found
[here](http://turistforeningen.github.io/leaflet-routing/examples/osm.html).

## Features

* Route handling interface for Leaflet
* Use your own routing backend, or OSM

## Usage

```javascript
var routing = new L.Routing({
  position: 'topright'
  ,routing: {
    router: myRouterFunction
  }
  ,tooltips: {
    waypoint: 'Waypoint. Drag to move; Click to remove.',
    segment: 'Drag to create a new waypoint'
  }
  ,styles: {     // see http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#polyline-options
    trailer: {}  // drawing line
    ,track: {}   // calculated route result
    ,nodata: {}  // line when no result (error)
  }
  ,snapping: {
    layers: [mySnappingLayer]
    ,sensitivity: 15
    ,vertexonly: false
  }
  ,shortcut: {
    draw: {
      enable: 68    // 'd'
      ,disable: 81  // 'q'
    }
  }
});
map.addControl(routing);
```

### Enable Drawing

```javascript
routing.draw(true);
```

### Enable Routing `NOT IMPLEMENTED`

```javascript
routing.routing(true);
```

### Enable Snapping `NOT IMPLEMETED`

```javascript
routing.snapping(true);
```

### Recalculate the complete route by routing each segment

```javascript
routing.rerouteAllSegments(callback);
```

### Get first waypoint

```javascript
var first = routing.getFirst();
```

### Get last waypoint

```javascript
var last = routing.getLast();
```

### Get all waypoints

```javascript
var waypointsArray = routing.getWaypoints();
```

### Routing to Polyline

```javascript
var polyline = routing.toPolyline();
```

### To GeoJSON

```javascript
var geoJSON3D = routing.toGeoJSON();
var geoJSON2D = routing.toGeoJSON(false);
```

### Load GeoJSON

Load GeoJSON with and without `properties.waypoints`.

#### Options

* `number` waypointDistance - distance between inserted waypoints for GeoJSON without waypoints.
* `boolean` fitBounds - fit map arround loaded GeoJSON.

```javascript
routing.loadGeoJSON(geojson, [options], function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log('Finished loading GeoJSON');
  }
});
```

## Events

All events form Leaflet.Routing is prefixed with `routing:`.

### Usage

```javascript
routing.on('routing:someEvent', function() {
  console.log('routing:someEvent triggered');
});
```
